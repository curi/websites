# Elliot Temple

I'm a philosopher. The diagram above shows the most important intellectual traditions I build on.

I research ideas, create educational material and run a [discussion forum][2]. Most of my writing is free at my websites and I use [YouTube][5]. I sell [digital educational products][3] and [consulting][4].

This site has [essays](https://www.elliottemple.com/essays) and my [debate policy](https://www.elliottemple.com/debate-policy).
