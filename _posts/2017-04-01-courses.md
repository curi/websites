Courses are your opportunity to get *expert guidance while you learn about a topic in depth*. I help you structure and organize your learning, answer questions, and get past sticking points. I guide you on topics that I've studied myself and become an expert on, and help you gain more expertise. I give personalized recommendations on what materials to study and what activities to do in order to make efficient learning progress.

These are *individual courses*, not group courses. You can interact with peers (and some experts), to get feedback, discussion and help, by posting your course-work on the public [Fallible Ideas discussion group](http://fallibleideas.com/discussion).

During a course, we'll interact over email, instant message, and audio call. You will *read books and articles, write notes and outlines, highlight important parts, ask questions, use video and audio content*, and more. I'll monitor your progress and help correct misconceptions about the course material or about approaches to learning. Plan to spend *5-15 hours per week* on your course.

Available courses are listed below. Price doesn't include course materials. If you have any questions, ask [et@elliottemple.com](mailto:et@elliottemple.com)

## Introduction to Popperian Epistemology

How does learning work? How do we know whether an idea is good? Around 1960, Karl Popper rebuilt the field of epistemology with his fresh answers to these age-old questions. Most experts had always known that induction was flawed; Popper expanded the criticisms to be more thorough and took them seriously instead of thinking induction must work, anyway, somehow. And, most importantly, he invented a new *evolutionary epistemology*, which provided a better approach. Because Popper's ideas are such a large advance, they aren't yet widely understood – but you can learn them today.

This course will help you understand Popper's key insights into learning and evaluating ideas. Using original source materials together with commentary by Elliot Temple, you'll get a clear understanding of the prevailing, mainstream view (induction and justificationism), see why the prevailing view is wrong, and learn Popper's improved view (conjectures and refutations). Elliot Temple's expert feedback and guidance will help you become skilled enough with Popper's ideas to apply them to decision making in real-world scenarios.

**Course Materials:** Popper book sections [listed here](http://fallibleideas.com/books#popper). Expect to go through the material from the first 3 books (green headings) at the top.

**Duration:** 3 months
